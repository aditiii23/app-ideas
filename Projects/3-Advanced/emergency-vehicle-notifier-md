## Technical Feasibility
This project consists of 2 major components. 

### The frst one is the REST API

The tools and technologies needed for deveoping the API are :
1. Firebase
2. Express.js
3. Node.js
4. Web API
5. Chai.js
6. Google Maps API
7. Google Places API
8. Google Directions API
9. Software engineering paradigms

### The second comoponent of the project is the cross-platform mobile client
The tools and tehcnologies needed for developing this client are :
1. Firebase 
2. Flutter
3. Dart
4. Provider.dart and Riverpod
Each of these technologies are freely availabke and the tehcnical skills required are manageable. Time limitatioms and the ease of implementing using these technologies are synchronized and are negligible.

## Resources
Resources that are required for the proper implementation of this project are :
1. Programming devices like personal computers, workstations, or laptops.
2. Hosting space on the local domain (freely available)
3. Programming tools
4. Programming inviduals
5. Web and Hosting services for client-server flow and the time required to store and process this information is neglible for the modern-day processorswhich work at very high clock speed.
6. Firebase Storage for cloud storage (freely available for the development phase)
